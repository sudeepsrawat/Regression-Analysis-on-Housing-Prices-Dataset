# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project utilizes the [Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset) from Kaggle to predict real estate prices using a Multiple Linear Regression model. The goal is to estimate property prices based on various housing features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more.

## 📌 Project Overview

The notebook includes the following key steps:
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model building using Multiple Linear Regression
- Model evaluation

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains housing attributes including:
- `Area`
- `Bedrooms`
- `Bathrooms`
- `Stories`
- `Parking`
- `Price` (Target variable)

Dataset source: [Kaggle - Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset)

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Multiple Linear Regression**

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
